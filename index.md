**About Me**

I’m a Data Science Manager with a strong foundation in economics and a passion for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. With several years of experience in the financial sector, I’ve led and delivered analytics and machine learning projects that support decision-making, risk assessment, and operational efficiency.

My background includes hands-on work in predictive modeling, statistical validation, and data pipeline development, as well as reviewing and improving code for accuracy and performance.

I enjoy leading and mentoring data science teams, helping others grow while fostering a collaborative, impact-driven environment. By combining technical expertise in Python, R, SAS, and SQL with a strategic understanding of business needs, I bridge the gap between data and action. My work in statistical model validation, risk analytics, and process automation has consistently led to improved accuracy, efficiency, and compliance in high-stakes environments.
