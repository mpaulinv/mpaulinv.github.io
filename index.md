**About Me**

Hi, I’m Mario Paulin Vega! Welcome to my portfolio.

I’m a Data Scientist with a background in economics and a genuine enthusiasm for making sense of complex data. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to lead projects in the financial sector that use analytics and machine learning to solve real business challenges. I have also worked as an analytics consultant and on academic projects. 

I enjoy the hands-on side of data science—building predictive models, validating results, creating data pipelines, and making sure the code is clean and reliable. But what drives me is collaborating with others: leading and mentoring teams, and growing while working together toward meaningful results.

My technical toolkit includes Python, R, SAS, SQL, Hive, and Spark and I enjoy learning new technologies. I’m equally passionate about understanding the bigger picture and connecting data work to strategic decisions. Whether it’s model validation, risk analytics, or automating processes, I’m committed to making data science practical, accurate, and impactful.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore my projects, check out my CV, or get in touch if you want to connect.
